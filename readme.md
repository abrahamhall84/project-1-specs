#WDI - Project 1

## FIRST PROJECT DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For the first project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of web application you create is your choice.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will be working **individually** for this first project. Show us what you've got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 2 models with an association.
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Your models should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses, and secure passwords.
* **External APIs.** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku. We will be covering this early next week.
	* A requirement for the Heroku deployment is to ensure you do not expose secrets in your app.  __Do not check secret keys into Github!__
* **Authentication** Your site should have an authentication component.  
* **Authorization** Where appropriate, you should implement an authorization scheme.  For example, if you make a blog app, other users should not be able to delete the posts that you create.


## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app:

* **Front-end Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation to kick-start your front-end.
* **Web Sockets** - Use [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) to have real time behavior in your app
* **Web Scraping.** Check out [Casper](http://casperjs.org/).

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you reasonably think you can implement in a week?  If you run out of time, will you have a working site without completing all that you meant to implement?  Try to think of the minimal feature set your site needs in order to function.  Get that working first, then focus on new features.
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.

####Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to your website hosted on Heroku
* Link to your source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

* __Friday, December 12th__ - Communicate your app ideas to an instructor. Be ready to talk about the scope of your project. Before beginning work on your project, your project ideas and the scope of your potential project must be checked-off by an instructor. You will begin working on the following bef
* ore and after project idea check-offs.
    - A plan for your pages
    - A well-defined and written out feature list 
    - A written Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
    - A list project milestones
* __Thursday, December 18th__ - Deploy your code to Heroku by the end of the day.  It is not important how much coding you have done at this point; deploy whatever you have.  Deploy to Heroku frequently to make your life easier.
* __Friday, December 19th at 9:30am__ - Project #1 Due and presentations 

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
__Code Quality__ Make sure that your code is:

* Well-commented
* Follows javascript coding conventions where appropriate
* Well-formatted (2 spaces of indentation per code block)
* Small commits pushed to github frequently.  The commits should focus on a single change. Avoid large commits that deal with many distinct changes to the code.

Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.
